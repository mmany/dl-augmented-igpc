# dl-augmented-igpc
A deep learning augmented solver in OpenFOAM built on top of the pisoFOAM solver, which uses a custom Inference Engine built with the PyTorch C++ Frontend (libtorch).
The Inference Engine currently supports only CPU operations, support for the use of the GPU for neural network inference is under development.

## About the solver
### Purpose and Theory
To be written.

## Installing dependencies
An official installation of OPENFOAMÂ® is required to compile this new solver.
The solver has been tested on OpenFOAM v6.
The installation instructions of the OpenFOAM software from *The OpenFOAM Foundation* can be found in the [official release website](https://openfoam.org/version/6/).
OpenFOAM can be compiled from source for performance but an installation with Docker is usually sufficient. 

This solver relies on a custom inference engine which supports openfoam objects from the repository [mmany/openfoam-pytorch-inference](https://github.com/mmany/openfoam-pytorch-inference).
The inference engine requires the following dependencies:
..* the PyTorch [C++ Frontend](https://pytorch.org/) (libtorch, tested version 1.11.0)
..* the JSON library from the repository [nlohmann/json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json)
A local installation of these dependencies is to be performed and shortly explained in the following in a linux environment.

### libtorch
```shell
wget -q -O libtorch.zip  https://download.pytorch.org/libtorch/cpu/libtorch-cxx11-abi-shared-with-deps-1.11.0%2Bcpu.zip
unzip libtorch.zip
rm *.zip
```
### nlohmann-json
```shell
git clone https://github.com/nlohmann/json
```
## Compiling
Environment variables are defined, to ease the access to the files of the previously downloaded libraries.
```shell
export TORCH_PATH="path/to/libtorch"
export JSON_PATH="path/to/json"
```
Make sure not to add the last "/".
### Compiling with cmake

CMake is a cross platform compiling framework that can be used to compile a C++ project.
In this solver the compiling process with the different libraries with *cmake* is more complex than its *wmake* counterpart.
The CMakeLists.txt file is provided for informational purposes and compiling with cmake with the CMakeLists.txt file fails at linking stage.
Any help would be appreciated !

### Compiling with wmake
** Tested for Openfoam-6 on a linux 64 platform. **
OpenFOAM offers its own make command *wmake*.
OpenFOAM distributions prior to OpenFOAM-9 are compiled using the C++11 standard, whereas libtorch compiles with the C++14 standard.
The compiling of OpenFOAM solvers using the C++14 standard is usually discouraged, and the whole OpenFOAM distribution should be compiled again from source using the C++14 standard.
However, compiling with C++14 doesn't seem to yield any errors.

We configure the wmake command to compile using the C++14 standard, by changing the compiling rules.
```shell
sed -i "s/-std=c++11/-std=c++14/g" ${FOAM_PATH}/wmake/rules/linux64Gcc/c++
```

Cloning the git repo and compiling:
```shell
git clone --recursive https://github.com/mmany/dl-augmented-igpc
cd dl-augmented-igpc
wmake

#Optional: sourcing openfoam in order to call the newly compiled solver bin
source $FOAM_PATH/etc/bashrc
```
## Testing
A test case is provided under the [test](./test) folder. The test case can be run with the following commands:
```shell
blockMesh
pisoFoamPC_CNN
```
The results are visualized with Paraview using:
```shell
paraFoam
```
Inside Docker, Paraview is particularly slow. Paraview can be run outside Docker by creating a \*.foam (empty) file at the root of the test case folder and  by opening it from Paraview.

## To Do

- [ ] Installation Process with cmake
- [x] Installation Process with wmake
- [x] Link dependency with libtorch and nlohmann-json
- [x] Test case
- [x] Linking with Inference engine as a submodule
